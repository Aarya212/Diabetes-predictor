Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes. 

- The objective of this project was to predict diabetes based on selected features. Dataset is trained using various Machine Learning models. And finally a web app is created using Flask which takes user input for result prediction.
